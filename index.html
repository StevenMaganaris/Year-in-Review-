		<h2>What has impacted me</h2>
		<p>This year has been a great year for me so far. Here I am going to talk about major events this year that have had a big impact on me and my family. Also, I know that this year has been very tough for a lot of families due to the whole COVID-19 situitan in terms of losing jobs, less money coming in etc... I am very lucky and grateful that my family is in a good place admist all of this. My best wishes goes out to all of the stuggling families out there. </p>
